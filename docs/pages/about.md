The present site is simple, with a style derived from
[JekyllBootstrap](https://jekyllbootstrap.com/) and
[Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) with a particular
theme. I'll explain how to create a site with exactly this style. If
you want something else, try the
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) automatic site generator, or
look at the [resources page](pages/resources.html).
